Liveness
1. State of general activity and motion
2. Requires a system to make progress
3. Not "stuck"
4. Something good will eventually occur

A program execution should ideally result in a success/error response, But if a program "hangs" it affects the liveness of the system.

Liveness issues with concurrency
1. Deadlock - Circular dependency issues. - synchronized block issues
2. Livelock( A smarter deadlock) - where your solution to a deadlock is inefficient.
3. Starvation - Thread is ready to run but is never given a chance.(low priority thread not scheduled by the executor, also called Indefinite postponement)
